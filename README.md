# 🦖 Jurassic Sphere

Jurassic Sphere is an **interactive dinosaur-themed web experience** built as our end-semester project.  
It doesn’t solve a real-world problem, but it was chosen because of its **cool factor** and creativity among all available project options.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

## 🌟 Challenges We Faced
- Implementing the **card flip animation** for dinosaur facts took significant brainstorming to perfect the transitions.
